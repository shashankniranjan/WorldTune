"""Outcome resolution: fill in what actually happened after a prediction.

Finds predictions whose horizon has elapsed relative to a supplied `now`,
fetches the realized return (using only bars with timestamp <= now), and
sets resolution fields (`resolved_at`, `actual_return`, `direction_correct`,
`result`). Critically, this NEVER touches the immutable fields set at
prediction time (direction, probability, expected_return, etc.) -- see
tests/test_outcome_resolver.py::test_resolution_does_not_mutate_prediction.
