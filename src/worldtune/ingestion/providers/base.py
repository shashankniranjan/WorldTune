"""`WorldEventProvider` port + per-provider health bookkeeping.

Every event source WorldTune can ingest from implements this one
interface, which means the rest of the pipeline (classify -> dedup ->
persist -> predict) is completely decoupled from *which* feeds are
configured. Providers that require credentials report
`is_available() == False` when those credentials are missing, and the
registry then skips them cleanly instead of crashing at startup -- this is
what lets WorldTune run with `WORLDMONITOR_API_KEY` unset.
