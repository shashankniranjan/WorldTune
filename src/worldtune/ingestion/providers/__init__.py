"""Event/context provider adapters.

Every real-world data source WorldTune can ingest from lives here behind
one of two ports defined in `base.py`:

  * `WorldEventProvider` -- discrete events -> `WorldEvent`
    (GDELT, USGS, EONET, GDACS, FIRMS, ACLED, World Monitor, synthetic)
  * `ContextDataProvider` -- macro/energy time series -> `SeriesPoint`
    (FRED, EIA); deliberately NOT event sources.

`registry.get_active_providers()` is the only thing the rest of the
pipeline needs to know about.
