"""Shared country-focus helpers for event providers.

`settings.country_focus` (env `COUNTRY_FOCUS`) narrows the free feeds to one
country instead of the global default. Providers apply it differently
depending on what their upstream API actually supports:

  * `gdelt.py`  -- server-side: appends `sourcecountry:<fips>` to every
    domain query (GDELT DOC 2.0 uses FIPS 10-4 country codes, not ISO).
  * `usgs.py`   -- server-side: adds a lat/lon bounding box to the FDSN
    query and the live summary-feed request.
  * `eonet.py`, `gdacs.py` -- neither API takes a country/region filter, so
    the provider fetches globally and filters the parsed results
    client-side using the bounding box + country-name check here.

This module only knows about a small hardcoded table (currently just
India); add more `CountryFocus` entries as more countries are needed.
