"""Deduplication / clustering of WorldEvent records.

Two complementary merge criteria run over the same union-find, in order:

1. **Cross-source geo/time/type merge** (first pass, added by the
   multi-provider refactor). Two records from *different* providers -- a
   USGS earthquake, a GDELT article about that earthquake, an EONET entry
   for it -- describe the same real-world event when they agree on
   time, place and kind. Embedding similarity cannot see this: USGS's
   `"M 7.4 - 18 km SSE of Hualien City, Taiwan"` and a newspaper's
   `"Powerful quake rocks eastern Taiwan"` share almost no tokens. So this
   pass matches on:
     * **time proximity** -- within `cross_source_window_hours` (default
       6h), tightened to `cross_source_geo_window_hours` (default 2h) when
       both records are point-located disasters, where the physical event
       is instantaneous and a wider window would over-merge;
     * **geographic distance** -- haversine within
       `cross_source_geo_radius_km` (default 150 km) when both have
       lat/lon; when only one does, geography is treated as unknown rather
       than as a mismatch and the other criteria must carry the match;
     * **event type/domain compatibility** -- same domain, plus compatible
       `event_subtype` (see `_COMPATIBLE_SUBTYPES`);
     * **entity/keyword overlap** -- a shared country/entity, or a shared
       significant headline/location token.

2. **Same-provider embedding-similarity merge** (the pre-existing path,
   unchanged in behaviour). Events inside `window_hours` whose embedding
   cosine similarity exceeds `similarity_threshold` AND which share at
   least one entity or country are the same story reported twice. This is
   what collapses near-duplicate news articles.

When records merge, `build_cluster_evidence` produces one `EventEvidence`
row per contributing source, so the non-winning records are preserved as
provenance instead of being dropped.
