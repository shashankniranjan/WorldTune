"""Central configuration for WorldTune.

All tunable thresholds and connection settings live here so that every
module (ingestion, prediction, evaluation, API, dashboard, jobs) reads the
same values. Uses pydantic-settings so values can be overridden via
environment variables or a `.env` file without code changes.

Data-source policy (see docs/data-sources.md):
  * `worldtune_mode` defaults to "free": only zero-cost providers are
    allowed to run. Providers that need a paid subscription (World
    Monitor) are hard-skipped in this mode.
  * `event_providers` defaults to the four no-key-required open feeds.
    Providers whose (free) registration key is absent disable themselves
    via `is_available()` rather than crashing -- see
    `worldtune.ingestion.providers.registry`.
