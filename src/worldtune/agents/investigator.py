"""AI investigator: turns a prediction + analogues into a structured,
plain-language explanation.

`Investigator` is the port. `TemplatedInvestigator` (default, used
everywhere in this prototype including tests) builds the explanation from
templated, rule-based text over the deterministic prediction output -- no
LLM call. `LLMInvestigator` is a pluggable skeleton that would call an
OpenAI-compatible endpoint using the prompts in `prompts.py` when
OPENAI_API_KEY is set; not used by default.
